&lt;p&gt;An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of

&lt;p&gt;The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.

Players battle the game’s many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt’s abilities and purchase equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the player’s choices at certain points in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html">The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">World of Warcraft</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/20/WorldofWarcraft.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="World of Warcraft" /><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/08/20/WorldofWarcraft</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/20/WorldofWarcraft.html">&lt;!-- Post under GAMES --&gt;

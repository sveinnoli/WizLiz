Cyberpunk 2077 is being developed by CD Projekt Red, an internal studio within CD Projekt, using the REDengine 4 game engine. They launched a new division in Wroc≈Çaw and partnered with Digital Scapes to assist production.

Cyberpunk 2020 creator Mike Pondsmith consulted on the project, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role.
